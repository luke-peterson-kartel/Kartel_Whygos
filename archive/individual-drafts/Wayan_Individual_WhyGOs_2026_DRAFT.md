Wayan Palmieri — Individual WhyGO Goals

2026 DRAFT — For Individual Goal-Setting Session

| Employee | Wayan Palmieri, SVP Head of Production |
| --- | --- |
| Reports To | Luke Peterson, President |
| Fiscal Year | January 1, 2026 - December 31, 2026 |
| Status | DRAFT — Pending Individual Goal-Setting Review |

# Context

These are Wayan's proposed Individual WhyGOs—separate from Production's Department WhyGOs. They answer: "What must Wayan personally do or become for Kartel to succeed?"

These will be finalized during Wayan's individual goal-setting session.

# Individual WhyGO #1: Build Leaders, Not Deliverables

WHY

Kartel cannot scale if Production depends on Wayan in every decision loop. His historical strength—high standards, stepping in under pressure—becomes a constraint at scale. For Production to support 20 clients without quality collapse, his direct reports must own outcomes, enforce boundaries, and make tradeoffs independently.

GOAL

Develop all four direct reports to operate with full decision authority within their domains, shifting Wayan's role from daily executor to exception handler and systems architect.

OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Decision categories delegated (scope, timelines, staffing, quality, margin) | 1/5 | 3/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 | Wayan |
| Escalations requiring Wayan per week | Baseline | -20% | -35% | -50% | Wayan |

# Individual WhyGO #2: Own the Execution Feedback Loop

Status: Requires CEO Approval

WHY

As Kartel scales, we pay a hidden learning tax. Sales closes deals based on assumptions. Production discovers real costs mid-execution. Platform builds without clean signals from the field. The same issues recur across clients. No one owns the synthesis. Result: Kartel scales faster than it learns.

GOAL

Establish and own a structured feedback system that captures execution reality, surfaces it to leadership monthly, and feeds actionable insights into pricing, scoping, platform roadmap, and sales enablement.

OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monthly Execution Truth Briefs delivered | 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | Wayan |
| Issues surfaced → changes made (pricing, SOW, platform, enablement) | 2 | 5 | 9 | 12+ | Wayan |
| Repeat issues (same problem 2x+ across clients) | Baseline | -25% | -40% | -50% | Wayan |

## Clarification on WhyGO #2

What this is: A structured feedback system—not extra meetings. Primary output is a monthly 1-2 page Execution Truth Brief that surfaces what broke, where assumptions were wrong, and what should change.

What this is not: A power grab or new org layer. It's a risk-reduction and learning acceleration function.

The ask: CEO explicit buy-in that this is needed, that Wayan should own it, and that it's not duplicative of other leadership functions.
